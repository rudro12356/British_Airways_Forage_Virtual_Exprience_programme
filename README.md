# British_Airways_Forage_Virtual_Exprience_programme

## Virtual Experience program from British Airways through Forage on Data Science
### Skills used - Python programming, Data manipulation and preprocessing, Machine Learning, Web scraping, NLP, Topic modelling
### This was a good experience with real world data and trying to figure the solution on my own. I definitely learnt a lot and there is a big scope of improvement, specially with data preprocessing, data visualization, EDA and understanding the results to provide insights on the given problem set.
